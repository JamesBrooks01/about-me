  <main>
    <p>Hello, My name is James Brooks, I am 20 years old. I live in the Greater Seattle Area, just east of Seattle. I have three pets, 1 dog and 2 cats. The dog is a large Bernease Mountain Dog named Hogarth. The cats are two brothers, one black named Snape, and the other orange named Weasley. I graduated High School in the summer of 2019 and got a job almost immedietly afterwards. I worked as an employee for Under Armour until the beginning of 2022 when I signed up for Code 102 having taken Code 101 a time prior. My goals are nothing special, I simply wish to live a quiet productive life where I can pursue my hobbies without monatary stress while working a job in a field I enjoy.</p>
