### About Me, With Guessing Game<br>

---

I built a basic HTML website to serve as an about me page, then implemented a simple prompt answer guessing game to make it fun. The website starts by prompting the visitor for a name and then gives a greeting back. Then after the visitor is done reading through my site, they can press the large purple button on the screen to start the guessing game. It will ask them a series of 5 questions based on the information provided in the biography.

Each prompt is capable of accepting any answer, be it;

- Correct
- Incorrect
- `null`
- `undefined`

Reflections and Comments<br>

Submission Questions

- How did this go, overall?
  - I think that it went quite well, I didn't experience any blockers and each problem cost only time.
- What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned so far?
  - I don't really have any. I understand the material quite well so far and everything seems to be going smoothly.
- How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
  - It took me about 3 hours to complete this assignment with another half hour for finishing touches. Before I started, I thought it would probably take me about 2 hours to do, but I knew that once I got into doing it I would find ways I wanted to improve and optimize the code until I would be satisfied, so a 3.5 hour time was within my expectations.
